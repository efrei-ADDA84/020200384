For this practical work I created a file named: main.tf where I put the configuration of the VM.

Comment use:

- Open your terminal and go to the path corresponding to your project
- Use the commands: terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply
- All you have to do is connect with the following command: ssh -i id_rsa devops@4.212.244.217 cat /etc/os-release
- Don't forget: terraform destroy
