For this practical work I created a file named: main.tf where I put the configuration of the VM.

Comment use:

- Open your terminal and go to the path corresponding to your project
- Use the commands: terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply
- All you have to do is connect with the following command: ssh -i id_rsa devops@4.212.244.217 cat /etc/os-release
- Don't forget: terraform destroy

The difficulties were mainly in the construction of the main.tf file with the understanding of the environment to be created, as well as the mastery of the public and private keys.
